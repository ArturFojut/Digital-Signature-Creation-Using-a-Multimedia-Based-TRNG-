# Digital-Signature-Using-a-Multimedia-Based-TRNG

This project introduces a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) implemented in Python, illustrating the generation and validation of a digital signature through the RSA cryptographic algorithm. The project employs Pythonâ€™s cryptographic libraries to execute these operations effectively. The primary aim is to elucidate the process of employing RSA keys to generate a digital signature that secures data integrity and verifies authenticity.
The conceptual foundation for this TRNG is derived from the innovative methods discussed in "Random Numbers Generated from Audio and Video Sources" by X. Y. Wang and I. T. Chen, utilizing multimedia elements as entropy sources.
